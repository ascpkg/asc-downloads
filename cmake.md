# Release (3.31.5)

The release was packaged with CPack which is included as part of the release. The .sh files are self extracting gziped tar files. To install a .sh file, run it with /bin/sh and follow the directions. The OS-machine.tar.gz files are gziped tar files of the install tree. The OS-machine.tar.Z files are compressed tar files of the install tree. The tar file distributions can be untared in any directory. They are prefixed by the version of CMake. For example, the linux-x86_64 tar file is all under the directory cmakeâ€“linux-x86_64. This prefix can be removed as long as the share, bin, man and doc directories are moved relative to each other. To build the source distributions, unpack them with zip or tar and follow the instructions in README.rst at the top of the source tree. See also the [CMake 3.31 Release Notes](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.31/release/3.31.html).
